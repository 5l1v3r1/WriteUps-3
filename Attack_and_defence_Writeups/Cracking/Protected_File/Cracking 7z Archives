An encrypted 7z archive containing a flag bearing file is available in your workspace. The archive password is chosen either from a dictionary or by using the default password policy. The 7z file and the dictionary file "1000000-password-seclists.txt" are present in the user's home directory.

Objective: Recover the password and get the token

If the dictionary attack does not work then the Password Policy could be:
Password length is less than 5 characters i.e. 0 < length < 5
Password can only contain characters from this character set:  0-9
John the Ripper and Hashcat are available on the system.

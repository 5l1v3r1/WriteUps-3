How many “encryption_algorithms” are supported by the SSH server.
What is the ssh-rsa host key being used by the SSH server.
Which authentication method is being used by the SSH server for user “student”.
Which authentication method is being used by the SSH server for user “admin”.

Instructions: 


This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :) 
Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
The Target machine should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3. 
Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1

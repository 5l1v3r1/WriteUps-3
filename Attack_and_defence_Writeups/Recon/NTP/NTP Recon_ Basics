Instructions: 


This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :) 
Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
The Target machine should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3. 
Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1

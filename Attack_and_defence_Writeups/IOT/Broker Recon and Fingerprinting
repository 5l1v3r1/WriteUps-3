Is MQTT running on the server? If yes, what is the port for MQTT over TLS?
What is the name and version of the MQTT server?
What command can be used to enumerate the MQTT server using NMAP script?
What is the welcome message set for topic "industrial"?
Which topic is being used by the sensors to publish their updates?
Session keys are being published on a topic periodically. What is the approx time period between appearance of two consecutive session-keys?
What is the command to post the content of file /etc/passwd to topic "confidential"?
Instructions: 


This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :) 
Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
The Target machine should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3. 
Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1

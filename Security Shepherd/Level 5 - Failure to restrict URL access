What is a Failure to Restrict URL Access?

An application that fails to restrict URL access is an application that is not protecting its "protected" pages sufficiently. This occurs 
when an application hides functionality from basic users. In an application that fails to restrict URL access, administration links are 
only put onto the page if the user is an administrator. If users discover a page's address, they can still access it via URL access.

Preventing unauthorized URL access requires selecting an approach for requiring proper authentication and proper authorization for each 
page. The easier the authentication is to include in a page the more likely that all pages will be covered by the policy.


The result key to this lesson is stored in a web page only administrators know about. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

step 1: 
inspect element on the web link, we see a div called hiddenDiv this states is only for Administrators
with the following 

<div id="hiddenDiv" style="display: none;">
					<!-- This is only displayed for Administrators -->
					<a href="adminOnly/resultKey.jsp">
						Administrator Result Page
					</a>
				</div>


Step 2: 
modifying the style to

style="display: block;"

this allows a pacge to be displayed
Administrator Result Page


Step 3: 
Clicking on the new link will give you access to the Key
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

What are Insecure Direct Object References?
Imagine a web page that allows you to view your personal information. The web page that shows the user their information is generated 
based on a user ID. If this page was vulnerable to insecure Direct Object References an attacker would be able to modify the user 
identifier parameter to reference any user object in the system. Insecure Direct Object References occur when an application references 
an object by its actual ID or name. This object that is referenced directly is used to generate a web page. If the application does not 
verify that the user is allowed to reference this object, then the object is insecurely referenced.

Attackers can use insecure object references to compromise any information that can be referenced by the parameter in question. In the 
above example, the attacker can access any user's personal information.

The severity of insecure direct object references varies depending on the data that is compromised. If the compromised data is publicly 
available or not supposed to be restricted, it becomes a very low severity vulnerability. Consider a scenario where one company is able 
to retrieve their competitor's information. Suddenly, the business impact of the vulnerability is critical. These vulnerabilities still 
need to be fixed and should never be found in professional grade applications.

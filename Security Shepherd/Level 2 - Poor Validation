What is Poor Data Validation?

Poor Data Validation occurs when an application does not validate submitted data correctly or sufficiently. Poor Data Validation 
application issues are generally low severity, they are more likely to be coupled with other security risks to increase their impact. 
If all data submitted to an application is validated correctly, security risks are significantly more difficult to exploit.

Attackers can take advantage of poor data validation to perform business logic attacks or cause server errors.

When data is submitted to a web application, it should ensure that the data is strongly typed, has correct syntax, is within length 
boundaries, contains only permitted characters and within range boundaries. The data validation process should ideally be performed on 
the client side and again on the server side.



To get the result key to this lesson, you must bypass the validation in the following function and submit a negative number.

Enter a Number: _____________


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: check the behavior of the box 

Entering the number 1 gives this response after a little delay 

Valid Number Submitted
The Number 1 is a valid number.

if i enter -1 I get the following 
 An Error Occurred:Invalid Number: Number must be greater than 0
 
 
 Step 2:
 upon checking the burpswuite for histroy we can see in clear data that userdata=1
 
 when entering 2 in the box it shows up userdata=2 +
 entering -1 or -2 does not give a request.
 so we can see we can direclty impact the post request as it seems to be handelded client side
 
 
Step 3:
starting the interception and entering a valid number of 2 we can see the request in the interceptor on burpsuite, modifying this to
minus "-1" and forwarding the request to the server. it goes trough and gives is the following showing that the validation was bypassed
and the info was sent to the server. 

Validation Bypassed

You defeated the lesson validation. Result Key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

What is Cross Site Scripting (XSS)?

Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS, issues occur when an application uses untrusted data in a web browser without sufficient validation or 
escaping. If untrusted data contains a client side script, the browser will execute the script while it is interpreting the page.

Attackers can use XSS attacks to execute scripts in a victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the 
user to malicious sites. Anyone that can send data to the system, including administrators, are possible candidates for performing XSS 
attacks in an application.

According to OWASP, XSS is the most widespread vulnerability found in web applications today. This is partially due to the variety of 
attack vectors that are available. The easiest way of showing an XSS attack executing is using a simple alert box as a client side script
pay load. To execute a XSS payload, a variety of an attack vectors may be necessary to overcome insufficient escaping or validation. The
following are examples of some known attack vectors, that all create the same alert pop up that reads "XSS".


<SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>
<IMG SRC="#" ONERROR="alert('XSS')"/>
<INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" ONCLICK="alert('XSS')"/>
<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>



The following search box outputs untrusted data without any validation or escaping. Get an alert box to execute through this function to show that there is an XSS vulnerability present.

step 1:
testing the bahavior by entering test into the search box returns

Search Results
Sorry but there were no results found that related to 'test'



step 2:
now we can attempt to add HTML with the following post

<img src="testimage.png" />

this returns
Search Results

Sorry but there were no results found that related to 'IMAGE'


Step 3: 
if you check the sourc eof the page for the image you can see the image was taken as HTML code and ran by the browser


step 4:
now we can throw something else onto it like the following <img src="testimage.png" onLoad="alert("XSS");" />

this gets the following result

Well Done
You successfully executed the JavaScript alert command!
